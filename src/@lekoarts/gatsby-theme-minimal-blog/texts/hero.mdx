  Hello, Homosapein o/
</Text>



I'm Naveen. Welcome to my tiny little space on the web :) 

I do stuffs with computers and sometimes write about it here. I also like to write about various life lessons
that I learn and sometimes use this place to brag about myself :P, Besides spending time with computers I love to:
 - Read books, especially fantasy fiction -  _Brandon Sanderson ‚ù§Ô∏è_ (_well it's fun to escape the world :3_)
 - Watch anything animated (_name a animated movie, I bet I must've watched it_ üòâ)
 - Eat high sugar content food (duh, who doesn't)
 - TDB.... (_I am still in the process of discovering myself, I aim to explore as many things as I can - before 
   somebody decides to pull the plug outta me_  xD)
