Hello Hoomans :3

Today I'll document how I went about building the latest Linus's tree. The 
Linus's tree is also called as `The Mainline Kernel`. 

As usual, I did face some hiccups (when don't I :P) while buildling it, I'll
write them down after I write down the gist of it below. No one's interested
in debugging anyway - Everybody wants things working fast :P

### Building the Linux Mainline Kernel

Here we gooooo 🧑‍🚀

##### 1. Install necessary tools

```bash 
sudo apt install build-essentials vim git cscope libncurses-dev libssl-dev bison flex
```

##### 2. Clone the Mainline Kernel/Linus’s Tree

```bash 
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git linux_mainline
```

##### 3. Copy the Old Config:

```bash
cd linux_mainline
make oldconfig
```

The above command reads the existing `.config` file that was used for an old 
kernel and prompts the user for options in the current kernel source that are 
not found in the file. 

If you do not know what the answer to the options should be, just go with the
default :)

##### 4. Compile the Kernel

```bash
make -j3 all
```

Now go grab, some pizza to eat - It's going to take atleast half an hour to
build. 🍕🍕🍕

##### 5. Install the Kernel

Note that the following steps, would install the kernel and it would be available
in your GRUB menu and you could boot into it and play with it :)

```bash
su -c "make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 install"
```

To understand why I used `INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1` please read below the problem I
faced and why I ended up using it.

### Problems 🐞 and Debugging 🕵️‍♀️

> Note: By the time you read this post, there are high chances that the following
might have been already fixed and addressed.

#### <u> pahole not found/ Outdated pahole in Ubuntu Repository </u>

It turned out that pahole and the dwarves libraries were not installed in my
system. Installing them from the Ubuntu repo did not work out, because the
mainline-kernel needed a pahole which was greater than the current available
version.

TODO: image 1

Upon searching I found that the [latest dwarves
library](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=dwarves) supported for
(20.04 Ubuntu) was 1.17.1 was upon downloading the deb and installing it I ran
into another problem.

TODO: image 2

Upon further discovery I found that the [above error was
patched](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dwarves-dfsg/+bug/1928244) in
a newer dwarves package. But unfortunately that is not supported by my Ubuntu
version. 

Reading through the patch file, I understood that the above error is occurring
due to some missing headers or symbols. And it clicked me that it could be
easily solved if I build the dwarves package from source.

And thus, I solved the above error by cloning the dwarves library and [building
it from source](https://github.com/acmel/dwarves).

#### <u> Zstd (Z standard compression) library was missing </u>

Due to the above library not being present in my system. I got the following
error.

TODO: image 3

Fixed the above problem by [installing the
zstd](https://howtoinstall.co/en/zstd) package.

#### <u> Stuck at Loading initrams during the boot of new Kernel </u>

After successfully building the image, when I tried to boot into the mainline
kernel, I got stuck at the loading of the initrd image. The error looked 
something like the below:

TODO: image 4 - stuck at initrams

When I investigated further, I saw that the size of the initrd image of the new
kernel was in hundreds of MB’s (750 MB to be specific)

TODO: image 5

Notice the size of the `initrd.img-5.14.0-rc3` file in the above image

Reading further I understood that Linux Kernel has two stage booting process.
First the initrd image is loaded and then that loads the linux kernel. And grub
is responsible for the initial step. But since the initrd image size was too
long, grub was having a difficult time trying to load the image and then finding
where the linux kernel is. 

Trying to figure out what actually happened, I came across this [Stack Overflow
answer](https://superuser.com/questions/705121/why-is-install-mod-strip-not-on-by-default)
which mentioned the use of `INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1` option.

Thus I understood that the reason why the size of the intird image is too large
is because the kernel modules are installed with debug symbols by default. And
thus running the following in the directory where the mainline kernel was
cloned, FIXED the problem:

```bash
su -c "make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 install"
```

To be really honest, I do not understand in depth why this actually happened and
why that option is not on by default. But maybe someday - I’ll come across this
again and understand ^^.

----------------

It was definitely a fun experience trying to compile the mainline kernel from
source and I have learned a lot of things from the very process of installing
the kernel. I can’t wait to see what else will I learn on my journey in getting
to know about how Kernel works ^^

Till then, Bhubyeeee
