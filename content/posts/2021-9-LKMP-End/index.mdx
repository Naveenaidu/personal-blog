Today is the last day of my Linux Kernel Mentorship Program. Wow! I honestly
can't beleive that I will be graduating as an Mentee from the program ^^

This blog is about me introspecting, recalling and expressing my experience that
I had during the span of the mentorship. As usual, there have been various
phases and emotions that I went through during the time. I'll take this
oppurtunity to give words to my abstract thoughts.

### Setting up the stage!!!

I remember the first time, I installed Ubuntu (_my very first Linux OS_) on my
laptop. To be really honest, installing ubuntu with no idea of what linux OS was
a very painful experience for me xD. I installed it only because it was mandated for
one of my undergraduate course.  The first few weeks with the Ubuntu were very
weird and hard for my brain to grasp. It was an entirely different paradigm than
what I was used to. I never had the kind of freedom which gave me the
powers to blow up and brick my laptop if I wanted to xD.

But as weeks turned into months, everything started to make sense. I fell in
love with the Linux Kernel and the things it powers. A mad respect for all the
people who created it/maintained it evoked within me, and I had this trinkling of
desire/courage to dream of having a very little part of my code be part of Linux
Kernel and get the oppurtunity to talk to the folks who maintain and make the
system which runs the world. But time passed, and the dream got written off into
unachievable section of my brain.

When I got to know about Linux Kernel Mentorship program back in 2019, all the
alarm bells withing me started ringing. I knew that this mentorship program can
be my gateway to realize my dream and I really really wanted to get selected to
the program. So I went ahead and applied, but I did not get selected - which
thinking back was a good thing. Beacause re-reading my application from 2019, it
was pretty evident that at that time, I did not possess the skills that were
required for the mentorship and had I been selected, I would not have done well.

And then again, time passed on, we got struck with COVID-19 and things got real
messy and I completely forgot about this until very recently. As people who know
me might tell - I am a very spontaneous guy, most of the things I do are all
based on whims and fancies of my emotions - there is usually very less concrete
planning before I do certain things. Sometimes they work out for the best,
sometimes they dont :3

But nevertheless, a few months back I was randomly browsing through few blogs
and I came across some blog which was explaining some Operating Systems
concepts, and I don't know how/why - All my interests in System Level
Programming and my dream of contributing to Linux Kernel got reinvigorated. I
really sometimes don't understand how my emotions work. Duhh!

And that's it, this single spark led me to the idea of reapplying to the Linux
Kernel Mentorship Program. Honestly, I did not even consider how would I be able
to manage both my Full time job at Hasura and the internship. But I decided to
apply and think about these later when things get selected.

I knew then, that if I did not apply at that moment - I won't ever get the
chance to do this. So the spontaneously stupid me, proceeded with my
application :P

### Initial Application Phase and my Hesistancy

For the uninitiated, the process to getting selected for the LKMP program is
like this:

1. You apply to the mentorship via LFX portal
2. Once applied, you are assigned some tasks
3. Before you start any tasks, it is highly recommended to read an excellent
guide written by Shuah. The guide is called 
[A Beginner’s Guide to Linux Kernel Development](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/a-beginners-guide-to-linux-kernel-development-lfc103/)
4. The lists of the tasks are used to screen potential mentees. i.e Once you
complete the first set of tasks, you may be given more tasks to complete. The
quality of your tasks submissions and the total number of tasks you complete is
used as an criteria to select potential candidates for the mentorship program.

I would personally advice everyone to atleast go through the 
[A Beginner’s Guide to Linux Kernel Development](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/a-beginners-guide-to-linux-kernel-development-lfc103/)
atleast once. This online e-course is exceptionally awesome and by the time you
finish this course, you'll get a really good idea of what it feels like
contributing to Linux Kernel. This course also helps you set up all the
necessary tools for sending patches to the Mailing lists.

IMHO, the application phase of the LKMP program is one of the best I have ever
seen. The tasks you get during this phase are really well thought out and they
are so much fun. The tasks are designed such that, if you were selected for the
mentorship, the knowledge you gain from the application phase alone is more than
enough to help you succedd through it.

Sooo... Yup!! I started my application process 20 days before the deadline.
Since I already applied back in 2019, I knew how things worked and had an idea
of where to start. That knowledge helped me focus more on the tasks and I saw
that I research and write as detailed answers for the tasks I can. Unlike 2019,
this time I did not have any expectations whatsoever, I just applied for the
sake of fun and to take away some learning during the application phase.

I was hesistant too, the standards that Linux Kernel community demands is very
high and I was not all confident in my skills. There was this big voice in my
head saying that I am not worth it and I won't ever get through it.

I am glad that I did not give in to that voice then. My advice to people who are
thinking of applying is to: "Don't Think - Just do it". What's the worst that
can happen? You don't get accepted, but even then - The learning you get during
the application process is still so awesome, that even in the worst case, you'll
still come away happy :)

TL;DR - Please do not be hesitant, Just apply - You never know what happens :)

### Acceptance Mail and New Doubts

As stated previously, I went ahead and completed the initial assignment phase
and submitted my application. I did not even have any hopes that I would be
selected, so I just forgot about it.

But then.. on September 1st, I recieved an email from Shuah congratulating me on
getting selected for the mentorship. I couldn't believe what I was reading. I
was on Cloud 9.

But after the shock(_happy one_) of acceptance sunk in and my neurons started
firing so many questions. 

Few prominent questions:

1. How will I manage both my full time job at Hasura and the full time LKMP
program?
2. Am I really worthy of it? Do I deserve this?
3. What if, I am unable to understand the PCI subsystem?
4. Do I even have the skills to contribute to Linux Kernel?

Discussing these questions with my family, they just said - "GO AHEAD, Don't
Overthink". So thus, I took the leap of faith.

But after almost 24 days into mentorship - I can positively say
that all my fears were misplaced. I've come to realize that, messing
things up is how one develops themself. I should not be scared of
messing things up, but rather focus on the learning/lessons you get once
that happens. And the fear of a new codebase will be a constant in the
life of a software engineer - I should not be worried about that and
have faith in one's skills and experience to overcome it.

I want to thank Bjorn for helping me come to the above realization.
Bjorn made the process very easy, he provided me with all the necessary
materials and references for the tasks and have been very active to
reply to my questions (_I apologize for loads of questions ^^'_). He
is very approachable and patient with my faults and questions. Thank you
very much Bjorn for this :)

There's also the misconception that I harbored before I began my mentorship,
that the Linux Kernel Community is not beginner friendly. But boy! I was totally
wrong about this. In my experience from doing many mistakes :3, I have found the
community to be very welcoming and patient and tolerant of new folks. The only
thing that you need to keep in mind, is to see that you give your best and try
to follow all the documented guidelines and just be open to learn from your
mistakes :)

### Work I did

Link to getting started with PCI, your tasks

Now, let me give a quick brief about the work I did during the Mentorship.

My project during the mentorship was "" ADD FROM THE LFX PAGE

For more information on how to get started with PCI subsystem you can read by
prev blog []()

I handled the tasks specifically related to AER error handling part. 

The thing I worked on:
 - as
 - asdas

My workflow was usually like this:

1. Bjorn had an excel sheet prepared with all the tasks and what needs to be
done.
2. I did some digging around in the code and once I had some idea, I talked to
Bjorn over email or IRC to clarify my doubts and solidify my understanding.
3. Once everything was clear, I went Clack Clack Clack :P (implemented the
changes)
4. Submitted the patch, Received Reviews and reiterated the patch based on
reviews
