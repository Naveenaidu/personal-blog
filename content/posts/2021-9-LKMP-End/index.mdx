Today is the last day of my Linux Kernel Mentorship Program. Wow! I honestly
can't beleive that I will be graduating as an Mentee from the program ^^

This blog is about me introspecting, recalling and expressing my experience that
I had during the span of the mentorship. As usual, there have been various
phases and emotions that I went through during the time. I'll take this
oppurtunity to give words to my abstract thoughts.

### Setting up the stage!!!

I remember the first time, I installed Ubuntu (_my very first Linux OS_) on my
laptop. To be really honest, installing ubuntu with no idea of what linux OS was
a very painful experience for me xD. I installed it only because it was mandated for
one of my undergraduate course.  The first few weeks with the Ubuntu were very
weird and hard for my brain to grasp. It was an entirely different paradigm than
what I was used to. I never had the kind of freedom which gave me the
powers to blow up and brick my laptop if I wanted to xD.

But as weeks turned into months, everything started to make sense. I fell in
love with the Linux Kernel and the things it powers. A mad respect for all the
people who created it/maintained it evoked within me, and I had this trinkling of
desire/courage to dream of having a very little part of my code be part of Linux
Kernel and get the oppurtunity to talk to the folks who maintain and make the
system which runs the world. But time passed, and the dream got written off into
unachievable section of my brain.

When I got to know about Linux Kernel Mentorship program back in 2019, all the
alarm bells withing me started ringing. I knew that this mentorship program can
be my gateway to realize my dream and I really really wanted to get selected to
the program. So I went ahead and applied, but I did not get selected - which
thinking back was a good thing. Beacause re-reading my application from 2019, it
was pretty evident that at that time, I did not possess the skills that were
required for the mentorship and had I been selected, I would not have done well.

And then again, time passed on, we got struck with COVID-19 and things got real
messy and I completely forgot about this until very recently. As people who know
me might tell - I am a very spontaneous guy, most of the things I do are all
based on whims and fancies of my emotions - there is usually very less concrete
planning before I do certain things. Sometimes they work out for the best,
sometimes they dont :3

But nevertheless, a few months back I was randomly browsing through few blogs
and I came across some blog which was explaining some Operating Systems
concepts, and I don't know how/why - All my interests in System Level
Programming and my dream of contributing to Linux Kernel got reinvigorated. I
really sometimes don't understand how my emotions work. Duhh!

And that's it, this single spark led me to the idea of reapplying to the Linux
Kernel Mentorship Program. Honestly, I did not even consider how would I be able
to manage both my Full time job at Hasura and the internship. But I decided to
apply and think about these later when things get selected.

I knew then, that if I did not apply at that moment - I won't ever get the
chance to do this. So the spontaneously stupid me, proceeded with my
application :P


I thank Shauh, Bjorn and all the other
mentors who took out the time to structure the program
