Heyo üëã

I am Naveen. I am a Software Engineer by profession. Persistance, curiosity and adaptability are my biggest
strengths. I love learning about the internals of a computer and someday I wish to achieve an eagle eye view
about how they function.

I got introduced to computers via Video Games (Specifically [this
one](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(video_game)#PC.2FMac)). I
spent most of my teenage cooped up in my room, figuring out a Windows PC and playing tons of Video Games,
which ended up with me, developing a sense of superiority about me knowing everything about computers. It
wasn't until I started my Undergraduate Computer Science studies in 2016 that I realized how dangerously wrong
I was in my perception.

The truth of the huge contrast between my _perceived_ reality and the _real_ reality devastated me, yet at the
same time it rekindled my childish curiosity and eagerness to learn everything there is about computers. Huh!
Thinking about it, I didn't even know how to _declare a variable_ back then. In a way, 2016 was the
year of my formal introduction to Computer Science and it's principles.

From then on, it has been a roller coaster ride, I fell in love with Open Source Software and ended up doing
[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6358992580771840/) and an
Internship under Linux Foundation for [The OpenMainframe
Project](https://github.com/openmainframeproject-internship/resources/blob/master/past/2019.md). I also
participated, organized and won a few hackathons :) 

My short exposure to Software Development might be the reason for why I haven't yet found my favorite domain,
favourer language etc etc. because everything seems so exciting and adventurous - I don't want to put a label
to myself and restrict myself to a field, I want to try out everything, _which I have been told is humanely
impossible_, but still - there's no harm in trying right? What am I going to loose anyway - There's only
upside in it, I'll get to learn more üòã
