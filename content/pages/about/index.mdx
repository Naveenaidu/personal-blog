Heyo üëã

I am Naveen. I am a Software Engineer by profession. Persistance, curiosity and
adaptability are my biggest strengths. I love learning about the internals of a
computer and someday I wish to achieve an eagle eye view about how they
function.

I got introduced to computers via Video Games (Specifically [this
one](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(video_game)#PC.2FMac)).
I spent most of my teenage cooped up in my room, figuring out a Windows PC and
playing tons of Video Games, which ended up with me, developing a sense of
superiority about me knowing everything about computers. It wasn't until I
started my Undergraduate Computer Science studies in 2016 that I realized how
dangerously wrong I was in my perception.

The truth of the huge contrast between my _perceived_ reality and the _real_
reality devastated me, yet at the same time it rekindled my childish curiosity
and eagerness to learn everything there is about computers. Huh! Thinking about
it, I didn't even know how to _declare a variable_ back then. In a way, 2016 was
the year of my formal introduction to Computer Science and it's principles.

From then on, it has been a roller coaster ride, I fell in love with Open Source
Software and ended up doing [Google Summer of
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6358992580771840/)
and an Internship under Linux Foundation for [The OpenMainframe
Project](https://github.com/openmainframeproject-internship/resources/blob/master/past/2019.md).
I also participated, organized and won a few hackathons :) 

My short exposure to Software Development might be the reason for why I haven't
yet found my favorite domain, favourer language etc etc. because everything
seems so exciting and adventurous - I don't want to put a label to myself and
restrict myself to a field, I want to try out everything, _which I have been
told is humanely impossible_, but still - there's no harm in trying right? What
am I going to loose anyway - There's only upside in it, I'll get to learn more
